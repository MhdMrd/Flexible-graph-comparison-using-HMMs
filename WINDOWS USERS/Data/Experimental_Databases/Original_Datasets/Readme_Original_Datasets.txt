1- A file named "$OriginalDatasetName$_output.txt" which contains statistics related to the original dataset.

2- A sub-directory named "$OriginalDatasetName$_OurFormat" which contains the raw text files   
   of the original dataset in the format taken by method proposed in [1].
   
3- A sub-directory named "$OriginalDatasetName$_TUDatasetFormat" which contains the raw text files   
   of the original dataset in the TUDataset format.
   
4- A '.zip'  file associated with the original dataset. This file can directly be used for classification purposes.
